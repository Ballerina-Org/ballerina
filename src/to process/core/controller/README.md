# Templates

## Definition

Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. Itâ€™s here where we start to see the design coming together and start seeing things like layout in action.

### Templates must:

- Group of organisms joined together to form a page
- Should be filled with data via props
- Should consist almost entirely of organisms

## TL;DR

Connecting organisms to create pages without getting the data.
