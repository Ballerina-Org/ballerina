Todo (✅/❌)
  ❌ give back/forward
  ❌ write guidelines
    ✅ adjust to new way of filtering the running of coroutines 
    ✅ write a quick-start
    ❌ adjust naming of foreign mutations (expected/exposed), update guidelines
    ❌ carefully review guidelines
    ❌ split into smaller files
    ❌ reference pages in a man/docs style or JSDoc
    ✅ explain monorepo
  ❌ add deep dive presentations
    ✅ forms
    ❌ data-driven forms
    ❌ views
    ❌ native vs web
  ✅ add help to create-domain command line tool (https://github.com/75lb/command-line-usage)
  ❌ create-domain
    ❌ broken in new setup - fix it
    ❌ add to guidelines
    ✅ add to readme
    ✅ convert dash to camelCase to create-domain
  ❌ publish
    ✅ split core and playground
    ✅ write readme
      ✅ credits to BLP and Hoppinger
    ✅ publish repo
    ✅ publish on LinkedIn
    ✅ publish core to npm
      ✅ add to readme
      ❌ publish create-domain within core
        ❌ add to readme
    ✅ Co.embed should accept undefined as a result of narrowing, in that case suspending the coroutine implicitly
    ❌ test core and create-domain from the npm package
    ❌ add a sponsor button and create a Patreon account
  ❌ coroutine wrapper name is currently anonymous (in React Developer Tools). can that be updated?
  ✅ coroutine runner extension. we currently have both *.ts and *.tsx you've mentioned that we will only have *.ts
  ❌ remove JS warnings (component children missing keys)
  ✅ table->tbody
  ✅ rename single-lettered type variables to decent names
  ✅ use pretty printer for AsyncState in all debug views instead of JSON.stringify
  ❌ card1...card3 use an extensibility pattern that could be embedded in the simpleUpdater<CardState, Extra = Unit> for easier reuse  
    ❌ the extensibility pattern of Cards in the dashboad deserves a global sample and a spot in the coroutines
  ✅ simpleUpdater should return a Fun 
    ✅ so that we can write ((cardsRepository.Updaters.Core.card3.then(dashboardRepository.Updaters.Core.cards))) instead of the ugly eta-expansion

  ✅ every domain should have both FM types
  ✅ the child2 foreign mutations expected should not reference Uncle
  ✅ mapView should accept a component with the `Children` prop
  ✅ embed should & the context and state in the first argument
  ✅ coroutine event handling
    ✅ remove the ugly event type parameter
    ✅ adjust the guidelines
    ✅ define `On` and `Cast` as methods invokable only when certain constraints (inbound/outbound `OrderedMap<Id, event>` fields) are present on the state, including `Id`s on the events
  ❌ sumUpdater
    ❌ left, right, both
  ✅ maybeUpdater
    ✅ left, both
  ❌ Map/OrderedMap of children
    ✅ automate Map/OrderedMap updaters
    ❌ add ChildN to Parent domain
  ✅ write readme
  ❌ form validations via responses of the datasync
  ❌ Unit should be different from {}
  ❌ rewrite InfiniteStreamState with Debounced/Synchronized
  ❌ tables with sorting and filtering
    ❌ define in combination with FormCollection
      ❌ add/remove
      ❌ reorder
  ❌ improvements that just help
    ✅ Updater constructors
      ✅ Updater.Default.fromState : S => Updater<S> => Updater<S>
    ✅ parent.child.x Updaters auto-chaining can actually be achieved
      ❌ simpleUpdaterWithChildren in another domain
        ❌ simpleUpdater.WithChildren in another domain
      ✅ the children passed must be mapped and the parent updater applied in order to auto-widen
    ❌ auto-chaining should support Sum, Map, and OrderedMap updaters out of the box
      ❌ this might be achieved by marking the simpleUpdater with a kind == "simpleUpdater", and the other 
        supported updaters (for example, simpleSetter = [x,y,z,...] => Updater(e => e+x,y,z,etc.))
        (for example, curriedSetter = [x,y,z,...] => [a,b,c,...] => Updater(e => e+x,y,z,a,b,c,etc.))
        then the widenChildren operator checks the kind and decides how to perform the mapping
  ❌ pair
  ❌ standard templates for unions, lists, trees, products, and sums

❌ Backend
  ❌ Coroutines
    ❌ Streams
  ❌ OData-style queries
  ❌ Some sort of scaffolder and query-generator connected to endpoints and based on coroutines
  ❌ Entities, relations, and permissions scaffolder
  ❌ Expressjs and some ORM
  ❌ Endpoints scaffolder
  ❌ Language-independent backend framework
