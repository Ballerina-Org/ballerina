        ❌ parser
        ❌ validator
    ❌ add state.TryFindX for enum, form, stream, and so on like for `state.TryFindType`
      ❌ use it in the codegen
      ❌ why can't we use state.TryFindType in the validators?
      ❌ Validate passes the context as a parameter instead of using GetContext - ugly

    ❌ create gui editor as an instance of a form itself
      ❌ form specification

            ✅ isolate thread evaluator, move to separate file in main project
            ✅ fix the ugly dancing ids of the active coroutines, they should remain the same
        ✅ do not delete events, mark them as done, with an index on the status
          ✅ add timestamp to events, process in creation order
          ✅ allow adding new events from coroutines
          ✅ POST should overwrite CreatedAt and ProcessingStatus
            ✅ even better, POST should not expect CreatedAt and ProcessingStatus (deserializer)
        ✅ add environment to the ./startup-be.sh launcher, otherwise we are using the wrong appsettings!!!
        ✅ processBs

        ❌ BUG ALERT if translating to production! The Map of events will likely cause events not to be processed in create-order
        ❌ test Spawn
          ❌ remove ugly starting logic, everything is bootstrapped by the endpoint that pushes the CreateABEvent
          ❌ create ABs from event
          ❌ when the AB coroutine ends, it is respawned (migration-friendly strategy)
        ✅ restore Async in Crud, run with Await
        ✅ dependent on repo's for AB and ABEvent

          ✅ move the various merge* utilities to extension methods
          ✅ rename `XCount`, etc. to just `X`
          ❌ the field descriptor definitions should use the operations from other field descriptors, and not perform any comparisons to entity descriptors Ids
            ✅ Get should be based on Lookup
            ❌ AB and CD should be based on generic containers of fields and nested entities, not real types
              ✅ the lookup of fields from ABs and CDs in the definition of the AB/CD entity schema should use the field definition lookup recursively
              ❌ the assignment (`Update`) of fields to ABs and CDs in the definition of the AB/CD entity schema should use the field definition assignment recursively
          ❌ there are various places where we assume `One entityId`, is this always reasonable?
            ❌ in particular, `Expr::execute` does not take into account more than one field lookup on the assigned variable, extend
      ❌ testing scenario
        ❌ define an algebra of business rules to support cascades like for the GLAccount defaulting
        ❌ add `CDs` to `AB`, so not just one
          ✅ use business rules for field setting
          ✅ test the conditions, not always `Exists ... true`
          ✅ introduce .System -> .User as prio, apply it to the set field events

              ❌ `AB_CD = { AB_CDId; ABId; CDId; IndexOfCDInAB }`
            ❌ `Exists ab_cd in AB_CD | ab_cd.ABId = <ab1.ABId> && Exists cd in CD | cd.CDId = ab_cd.CDId |= [cd.EF := <ef1.EFId>]`
            ❌ the `&&` operator propagates variables from both operands
            ❌ the `||` operator propagates the intersection of variables with the same type from both operands
            ❌ `Exists ab in AB | true |= [ab.Total1 := sumBy(Exists ab_cd in AB_CD | ab_cd.ABId = <ab1.ABId> && Exists cd in CD | cd.C + cd.D)]`
            ❌ `Exists cd = new CD(...) | Exists ab_cd = new AB_CD(<ab1.ABId>, cd.CDId) | true |= []`
              ❌ all fields of new entities are marked as modified

        ❌ we don't need `One` anymore, do we? Let's move all to `Multiple`
        ❌ rename `positions` to `abcd`
        ❌ add an enum parameter to pick the edit to test
      ❌ make it production-ready
        ❌ define the values of AB, CD, etc. as instances of `Value`
          ❌ to base everything on Value, Fields and lookup types need an ID, not just the name
            ❌ then we can deprecate FieldId, EntityId, etc.
        ❌ do not commit the updates to the context immediately, output a set of field value changes
          ❌ the context becomes a cache of operations
          ❌ output the applied rules for the visibility/explainability/logging
          ❌ monadically
        ❌ expose OpenAPI
            ❌ [Swagger](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.SystemTextJson.Swagger)

          ❌ a few thousands ABs, CDs, EFs
          ❌ a dozen rules on many field "clusters"
        ❌ the construction of field descriptors in the schema could be streamlined
        ❌ the metadata entities belong to the model, not to Ballerina
        ❌ all rules should be applied on all entities after creation of a new entity
        ❌ BUG ALERT if translating to production! The Map of events will likely cause events not to be processed in create-order
        ❌ allow approval, with associated business rules
        ❌ deal with missing references (GUIDs that do not match an existing entity)
        ❌ introduce list monad with errors for eval/execute
          ❌ return useful error messages
        ❌ the resolution of top-level existentials like `exists ab in AB | ab.ABId = CONSTGUID` should be resolved much faster
        ❌ implement lazy fields in the schema
          ❌ this requires a coroutine-mediated protocol
          ❌ openSession(schema) -> operations | closeSession()
          ❌ when the schema is fully dynamic, get/update operations work with reflection/`Dynamic` CLR type
        ❌ consider flipping the relations around, using arrays/maps instead of relations
        ❌ -----at this point, the prototype can be considered reasonably done and could go live as a microservice-----
        ❌ the evaluation of existentials with conditions over foreign keys can be ran very quickly with lookup tables
        ❌ efficiently: with pre-caching of the FREE-VARS of both condition and expression value

      ❌ remove every single instance of mutation
      ❌ separate DB serialization as a different EF package
        ❌ represent Expr as JSON
        ❌ represent Expr as a recursive structure looked up with a recursive query
      ❌ extend the `ABCDEvent` definition to include a processed state and a created time
      ❌ add an `EventDesc` to `FieldEvent`
        ❌ useful for pre/post event actions and conditions, it defines that which is passed to co.On plus a pre- and post-condition coroutine
        ❌ it is polymorphic and distributed over the concrete instances (ie `SetIntField of IntEventDesc`, ...)
      ❌ define custom rules and make the priority of assignments actually count
      ❌ persist the entities to Elasticsearch
      ❌ persist the entities to Postgres
        ❌ enums to strings

      ❌ control creation of extended entities (AB inside ABEvent for example)
    ❌ low-code platform
      ❌ business rules (of which defaultings are a data-driven instance) should be just data

    ❌ separate Crud from AsyncCrud
    ❌ parameterize the coroutine queries serialization/deserialization
    ❌ add history/enqueued events endpoints for AB sample

    ✅ Co.embed should accept undefined as a result of narrowing, in that case suspending the coroutine implicitly
    ❌ test core and create-domain from the npm package
    ❌ add a sponsor button and create a Patreon account
  ❌ coroutine wrapper name is currently anonymous (in React Developer Tools). can that be updated?
  ✅ coroutine runner extension. we currently have both `*.ts` and `*.tsx` you've mentioned that we will only have `*.ts`
  ❌ remove JS warnings (component children missing keys)
  ✅ table->tbody
  ✅ rename single-lettered type variables to decent names
  ✅ use pretty printer for AsyncState in all debug views instead of JSON.stringify
  ❌ card1...card3 use an extensibility pattern that could be embedded in the simpleUpdater<CardState, Extra = Unit> for easier reuse
    ❌ the extensibility pattern of Cards in the dashboad deserves a global sample and a spot in the coroutines
  ✅ simpleUpdater should return a Fun
    ✅ so that we can write ((cardsRepository.Updaters.Core.card3.then(dashboardRepository.Updaters.Core.cards))) instead of the ugly eta-expansion

  ✅ every domain should have both FM types
  ✅ the child2 foreign mutations expected should not reference Uncle
  ✅ mapView should accept a component with the `Children` prop
  ✅ embed should & the context and state in the first argument
  ✅ coroutine event handling
    ✅ remove the ugly event type parameter
    ✅ adjust the guidelines
    ✅ define `On` and `Cast` as methods invokable only when certain constraints (inbound/outbound `OrderedMap<Id, event>` fields) are present on the state, including `Id`s on the events
  ❌ sumUpdater
    ❌ left, right, both
  ✅ maybeUpdater

      ❌ add/remove
      ❌ reorder
  ❌ improvements that just help
    ✅ parent.child.x Updaters auto-chaining can actually be achieved
      ❌ simpleUpdaterWithChildren in another domain
        ❌ simpleUpdater.WithChildren in another domain
      ✅ the children passed must be mapped and the parent updater applied in order to auto-widen
    ❌ auto-chaining should support Sum, Map, and OrderedMap updaters out of the box
      ❌ this might be achieved by marking the simpleUpdater with a kind == "simpleUpdater", and the other
        supported updaters (for example, simpleSetter = [x,y,z,...] => Updater(e => e+x,y,z,etc.))
        (for example, curriedSetter = [x,y,z,...] => [a,b,c,...] => Updater(e => e+x,y,z,a,b,c,etc.))
        then the widenChildren operator checks the kind and decides how to perform the mapping
  ❌ pair
  ❌ standard templates for unions, lists, trees, products, and sums
